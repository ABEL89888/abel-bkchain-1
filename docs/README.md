## Staking
Abel-bkChain uses NPoS (Nominated Proof-of-Stake) as its mechanism for selecting the validator set. It is designed with the roles of validators and nominators, to maximize chain security. Actors who are interested in maintaining the network can run a validator node. At genesis, Abel will have a limited amount of slots available for these validators, but this number will grow over time to over one thousand.

The system encourages ABEL holders to participate as nominators. Nominators may back up to 16 validators as trusted validator candidates.

Validators assume the role of producing new blocks in BABE, validating parachain blocks, and guaranteeing finality. Nominators can choose to back select validators with their stake.

The staking system pays out rewards equally to all validators regardless of stake. In other words, having more stake on a validator does not influence the block rewards they receive.
